Automated UI and API tests using C#, NUnit, Selenium, RestSharp, and FluentAssertions.

This project showcases clean, maintainable test automation for both web UIs (e.g., SauceDemo) and REST APIs (e.g., Restful Booker). Tests are written using best practices like Page Object Models, assertion helpers, and CI integration via GitHub Actions.
