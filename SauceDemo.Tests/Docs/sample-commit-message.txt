test: Add logout scenarios for basic logout, redirect, and access control (#3)
Adds supporting utilities:
- BrowserHelper: browser-level controls (url navigation, back button, etc)
- WaitHelper: wait for the menu to open before clicking the logout

Adds new POMs and Step Binding:
- LogoutSteps: step bindings for logout scenarios
- ProductsSteps: step binding for accessing products page
- ProductsPageObject: enables "open products page" step

Modifies existing code:
- LoginPageObject and MenuPageObject: now use BrowserHelper
- BaseSteps:
  - Renamed `Page` to `PageObject` for clarity (esp. when working with MenuPageObject)
  - Changed `driver` to protected so steps can use BrowserHelper
- ErrorFeedbackSteps, LoginSteps, ShellSteps: renamed member `Page` to `PageObject`

- Modifies Logout.feature to validate:
  - Logout link redirecting user to the login page
  - Logged out users cannot access protected pages via back button
  - Logged out users cannot access protected pages via direct URL
