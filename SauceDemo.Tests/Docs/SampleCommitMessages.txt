test: Add logout scenarios for basic logout, redirect, and access control
Adds supporting utilities:
- BrowserHelper: browser-level controls (url navigation, back button, etc)
- WaitHelper: wait for the menu to open before clicking the logout

Adds new POMs and Step Binding:
- LogoutSteps: step bindings for logout scenarios
- ProductsSteps: step binding for accessing products page
- ProductsPageObject: enables "open products page" step

Modifies existing code:
- LoginPageObject and MenuPageObject: now use BrowserHelper
- BaseSteps:
  - Renamed `Page` to `PageObject` for clarity (esp. when working with MenuPageObject)
  - Changed `driver` to protected so steps can use BrowserHelper
- ErrorFeedbackSteps, LoginSteps, ShellSteps: renamed member `Page` to `PageObject`

- Modifies Logout.feature to validate:
  - Logout link redirecting user to the login page
  - Logged out users cannot access protected pages via back button
  - Logged out users cannot access protected pages via direct URL



test: Add scenarios for cart content preservation after logout (includes framework for validating product data across all 4 pages)
- Adds product validation framework:
  - ProductMeta: model representing a product’s display data
  - ProductName: parses and validates test-input product names
  - ProductNames: known product constants used in validation
  - ProductExpectations: source of expected product values for tests
  - ProductAreaComponent: COM for interacting with product DOM across 4 pages
  - ProductAreaSteps: step bindings for asserting product data

- Adds new cart + logout scenarios:
  - Logout.feature: new tests verifying cart contents persist after logout

- Adds common utilities and components:
  - ElementExtensions: generic helpers for querying elements in COMs/POMs (BasePageObject usage to be deprecated)
  - BaseComponent: base class for all COMs
  - CartIconComponent: COM for interacting with the cart icon
  - BaseSteps: adds generic COM creation
  - BrowserSteps: handles browser-level steps (navigation, reload, etc.)
  - CartIconSteps: step bindings for cart icon
  - InventorySteps: step bindings for Inventory page
  - MenuSteps: step bindings for menu interactions

- Refactors and cleans up existing code:
  - LogoutSteps: deleted and its logic moved into BrowserSteps and MenuSteps

- Renames Products → Inventory for clarity:
  To clarify the overloaded use of "Product", ProductsPageObject and related step files/features were renamed:
  - InventoryPage.cs, ProductsPageObject.cs
  - CheckoutComplete.feature, CheckoutOverview.feature, Inventory.feature, MenuComponent.feature, Products.feature, ProductsSteps.cs

- Configuration changes:
  - .editorconfig: disables SA1649FileNameMustMatchTypeName due to StyleCop not supporting record types properly
  - specflow.json: configures SpecFlow to fail tests on missing or pending steps
